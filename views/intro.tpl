<h1>Introduction</h1>

Warning hacking can be illegal, please do so responsibly and at your own risk.

<h2>Step 0 - Install linux</h2>


Linux is not an operating system<br>
Linux is a kernel<br>
<br>
[insert reasons for choosing linux]
<br><br>
Some choices of linux distributions:
<br>
<ul>	
	<li>ubuntu - generic linux distro i guess</li>
	<li>kali - comes with lots of security programs preinstalled</li>
</ul>

Things you may want to learn:

<ul>
	<li>terminal</li>
	<li>linux</li>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>bash</li>
	<li>programming</li>
</ul>

Advanced:

<ul>
	<li>x86 assembly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1 - Gain knowledge</h2>

There are subjects at usyd that teach programming/linux  
I will mention some which teach security here
<br><br>

<table>
	<td><h2>Usyd Subjects</h2></td>
	<tr><td><a href="https://elec5616.com/lectures.html">elec5616</a> - Computer and Network Security,Theory Based Large amounts of information relating to security</td></tr>
	<tr><td>comp5618 - Applied Cybersecurity, Quality course, it is a continuation of elec5616. Focuses more on practical work.</td></tr>
</table>

<br>
There are other resources that will teach you about linux, programming, computing, security.
<br><br>
I have placed them [insert link to resoruces].


<h2>Step 2 - Practical</h2>

CTF - capture the flag
<br><br>
A ctf is a series of security puzzles.
<br><br>

<a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/"> Bandit CTF</a> - Extremely good ctf that focuses on terminal skills. 
Done via ssh which forces you to only use the terminal.
<br><br>
the google ctf, also see the resources section
<br><br>
google is your friend  
stackoverflow is your friend
<br><br>
For both programming/hacking and literally everything in general.

<h2>In Summary:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Install linux</li>
	<li>Learn to program</li>
	<li>Learn to use a terminal</li>
	<li>Do security subjects at usyd and/or read their course notes
and or consume security/computer knowledge in general</li>
	<li>Complete the bandit ctf</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Research</li>
	<li>Practice</li>
	<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
